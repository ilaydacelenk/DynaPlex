/**
 * MDP configuration file demonstrating a specific MDP configuration.  
 * - Files under models/_subdir_/_filename_.json are copied to DYNAPLEX_IO_ROOT_DIR/IO_DynaPlex/mdp_config_examples/_subdir_/_filename_.json
 *  where executable and mdp_unit_tests look for them. 
 * - Providing MDP configuration files is not required, but serves as documentation. 
 * - It also simplifies unit_tests, see tests/mdp_unit_tests/*.cpp.
